# HANGMAN GAME

This project is a simple game. The player's role is to guess the phrase based on the hint.
The player starts the game by pressing his first letter. After that, it will start counting and every seven seconds, if the player doesn't press any letter, random letter will be picked automatically. If the player presses the letter that is not in the phrase then sum of possible mistakes is reduced by 1 (7 mistakes max).
To win, the player must guess the phrase.
